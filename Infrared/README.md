# Controlling an LED using Infrared

## What

Simple project to control an LED using an infrared beam.
This was also used to check the IR protocols and commands of various remotes i have.

This project then turned into an OLED screen tryout displaying data from a DHT sensor

## Why

This was made for learning purposes. To understand how low frequency IR beams work.
I was also curious to look into several IR implementations of remotes.

## Used components
- IR receiver module
- leds
- 1.3 INCH oled SH1106 driver
- DHT (22) sensor
